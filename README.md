# MOVIE RECOMENDATION SYSTEM USING MACHINE LEARNING BASED ON PREVIOUS REVIEWS FROM OTHER USERS (NETFLIX)

## Project Overview
We found a big opportunity in movie streaming channels. Our finfdings showed us that users can spend between 20 - 40 minutes browsing movie catalogues while trying to decide which movie they'd like to watch. Our project cosist on delveloping a solution to reduce that time span to a minimun while offering the best recomendations based on information the user provides, while the system analyses previous reviews from other users in a data base and deliver an accurate recommendation to our users. 

Our business proposal aims to be replicated to search into any streaming catalogue. The objective is to close deals with all the available commercial streaming companies, in order to be an user charge-free platorm, making it quite attractive to the final consumer. 

## Data-source description
> The datasources are an extractions from Netflix catalogue broken down into two sets. 
> The first set consists in the hard characteristics from the movie catalogue, Movie_ID, Year; Name. This data set is named Netflix_Dataset_Movie.CSV
> The second dataset contains the rating information from the the same movie catalogue and it consists in User_ID, Rating, Movie_ID. This data set is named Netflix_Dataset_Ratings.csv
